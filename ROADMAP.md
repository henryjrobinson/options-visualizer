  - Color-coded visualization with clear legends
  - Strategy recommendations based on IV patterns
- **Options Chain Table**:
  - Three-column layout (Calls, Strike, Puts)
  - Sortable columns
  - Highlighting for selected options
  - Quick filters for strike range

### 3. Detailed Analysis Components
