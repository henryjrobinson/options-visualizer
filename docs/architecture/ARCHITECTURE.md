# Options Visualizer Architecture

## Overview

The Options Visualizer is a modern web application designed to help traders visualize and analyze options trading data, with direct integration to the Alpaca Trading API for real-time data and order execution. The application follows a client-server architecture with a React frontend and FastAPI backend.

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. It follows a component-based architecture with the following key components:

- **App Component**: The root component that manages routing and global state
- **OptionsVisualizer Component**: The main visualization component that displays options data
- **AccountInfo Component**: Displays user account information from Alpaca
- **OrderForm Component**: Handles options order creation and submission
- **OptionSearch Component**: Allows users to search for specific options

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built with FastAPI and serves as a proxy to the Alpaca API. It provides the following endpoints:

- **/api/stock/{symbol}**: Fetches stock data for a given symbol
- **/api/options/{symbol}**: Fetches options chain data for a given symbol
- **/api/account**: Fetches account information
- **/api/order**: Places options orders

### Data Flow

1. User interacts with the React frontend
2. Frontend makes API calls to the FastAPI backend
3. Backend proxies requests to the Alpaca API
4. Backend processes and transforms the data
5. Frontend receives the data and updates the UI
6. User views the visualized options data

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: UI library
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Axios**: HTTP client
- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **React Router**: Client-side routing

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: API framework
- **Pydantic**: Data validation
- **Requests**: HTTP client
- **Python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

### External Services
- **Alpaca Trading API**: Stock and options data, account management, order execution

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in environment variables and never exposed to the client
- Backend serves as a proxy to prevent exposing API credentials
- CORS is configured to restrict access to the API
- Input validation is performed on both client and server

## Scalability Considerations

- The application is designed for single-user usage
- The backend can be scaled horizontally if needed
- Caching strategies can be implemented for frequently accessed data
- WebSockets can be used for real-time updates to reduce API calls

## Future Architecture Considerations

- Implement WebSockets for real-time data updates
- Add user authentication and authorization
- Implement a database for storing user preferences and historical data
- Add support for additional brokers beyond Alpaca
